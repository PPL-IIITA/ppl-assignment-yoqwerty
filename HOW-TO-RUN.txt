Set the current working directory path to the path where the project is present.
(NOTE: n is the question number, for eg quest3 ,here n=3)
Change the path to questn.Reach dist folder of that question.

Now on the command prompt, type:

java -jar questn.jar (n is the question number.for eg quest3)

So, the command is "cd quest3/dist java -jar quest3.jar"
